# Bachelor's Thesis

This repository shows the latex project of my bachelor's thesis. 
[Here's a link to the compiled bachelor's thesis PFD document](https://github.com/AmitJerochim/bachelors_thesis_microservices/blob/main/thesis.pdf)
Below you also find links to the prototypes that I implemented using java, bash, kotlin, and node.js.

## Prototypes

[Swaggerhub Crawler](https://github.com/AmitJerochim/swaggerhub-crawler) is a web crawler written in java and using selenium that collects OpenAPI documents from SwaggerHub.

[OpenAPI data](https://github.com/AmitJerochim/openapi-data) is a project containing all the raw data collected by the [Swaggerhub Crawler](https://github.com/AmitJerochim/swaggerhub-crawler).

The [openISBT analyzer](https://github.com/AmitJerochim/openISBT_analyser) is a tool to analyse the applicability of [openISBT](https://github.com/martingrambow/openISBT) to openSource REST APIs. It is mainly written in bash and also uses node.js. 

Based on my findings using the [openISBT analyzer](https://github.com/AmitJerochim/openISBT_analyser) I implemented matching units in kotlin which will become part of [openISBT](https://github.com/martingrambow/openISBT).
