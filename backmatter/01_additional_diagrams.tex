\section{Results of the Data Cleaning for the Second Measurement Execution}
\label{app:results_data_cleaning2}
The evaluation tool we present in section \ref{sec:eval_tool:overview_design} removes OpenAPI documents for each measurement execution. In the second measurement execution, we use the same sample of OpenAPI documents as the first measurement execution but another openISBT version. Figure \ref{fig:pie_chart:shares_of_removed_apis_after_extention} shows the frequency distribution of the processed OpenAPI documents for the second measurement execution. It is almost the same as in figure \ref{fig:pie_chart:shares_of_removed_apis_before_extention} but shows a minimal increase of OpenAPI documents that cause exceptions.
