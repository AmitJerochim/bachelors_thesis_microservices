\subsection{Setup of the Measurement}
\label{sec:analysis_1:setup}
The measurement's setup defines the required input for benchmark execution. First, it requires a specific openISBT version. For this measurement we use openISBT v0.2\footnote{\url{https://github.com/martingrambow/openISBT/releases/tag/v0.2}}, as we want to evaluate the current state. Second, it requires a set of OpenAPI documents\footnote{\url{https://github.com/AmitJerochim/openapi-data}}. Finally, it requires a pattern configuration file. This file defines the abstract interaction patterns. We mention in section \ref{sec:bg_pattern_based_approach} that openISBT defines workload for interaction patterns, which are sequences of abstract operations. 
However, we require information about supported service operations, so we define in the pattern configuration for each abstract operation an abstract interaction pattern containing only this abstract operation.
