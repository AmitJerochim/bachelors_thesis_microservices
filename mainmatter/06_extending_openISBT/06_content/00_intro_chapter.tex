This chapter describes our contributions to openISBT. To contribute to openISBT, we investigate service operations that openISBT does not support and classify them based on their functionality. We implement different tools to ease the grouping, but we investigate the service operations manually. Section \ref{sec:extending:general_considerations} discusses the general properties and requirements of abstract operations and their corresponding matching units\footnote{\url{https://github.com/AmitJerochim/openISBT_analyser/tree/master/matching_units}}. Section \ref{sec:extending:improving_existing_matching_units} discusses findings to unsupported service operations, which should theoretically match existing abstract operations. It also explains why they do not match, and how we extended the matching units to match them. Finally, section \ref{sec:extending:deriving_new_matching_units} discusses use-cases and samples where new abstract operations and matching units are required.
