\section{Deriving New Abstract Operations and Implementing Matching Units}
\label{sec:extending:deriving_new_matching_units}
For those service operations, which openISBT does not support because current abstract operations do not describe their functions, we derive new abstract operations and implement new matching units. In the following, we present four new functions, which describe the purposes of several service operations. We also discuss service operations' common properties, which are relevant for the matching process.
