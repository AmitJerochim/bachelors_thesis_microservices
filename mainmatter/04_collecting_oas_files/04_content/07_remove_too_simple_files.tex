\subsection{Discarding Non-production OpenAPI Documents}
As we want to analyze services used in production, we have to remove API descriptions of other APIs before doing our analysis, which would result in a manual investigation for each file. As this seems to be infeasible for large sets, we automatically reduce non-production data. We make a hard assumption that short OpenAPI documents are probably not used in production to implement automation. This approach results in a trade-off as we, on the one hand, might discard small APIs used in production but, on the other hand, might keep undesired documents. Using a boundary of 100 LOC, we mostly discard wanted documents, which is tolerable as long as we keep the number of unwanted documents in our sample small.
