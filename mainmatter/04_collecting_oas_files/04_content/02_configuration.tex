\subsection{Configuring the WebDriver Instance}
The first and also a relatively short step is the creation and configuration of the browser instance. For this, we use the Java WebDriver library\footnote{\url{https://www.selenium.dev/selenium/docs/api/java/}} provided by Selenium and geckodriver\footnote{\url{https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver}} provided by Mozilla.
The configuration is done by setting the window size of the WebDriver, i.e., the browser, to full screen. This step is crucial as we use awt.Robot\footnote{\url{https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/awt/Robot.html}}, which interprets coordinates as display coordinates, while the WebDriver API interprets them as browser coordinates. Therefore, setting the window size to full screen makes both APIs interpret coordinates as the same position on the display.
