Microservices architectural style steadily replaces monolithic architectures to improve development processes and maintenance of large and distributed software applications \cite{martin_fowler_microservices, otto_microservices}. In this work, we evaluate the applicability of openISBT, a pattern-based benchmarking framework designed for microservices.
This chapter presents the problems we try to solve and the goals we try to achieve. Also, it conveys an overview of this thesis's structure.
