\section{Goals of the Thesis}
\label{sec:goals}

This thesis aims to evaluate and extend the applicability of openISBT to open source microservices APIs. To achieve our goals, we will make the following contributions.

\begin{cEnum}
    \item Implementing a web crawler and collecting a large set of OpenAPI 3.0 files
    \item Designing and implementing a tool to evaluate the applicability of openISBT for the set of collected OpenAPI 3.0 files
    \item Quantifying the applicability of openISBT
    \item Deriving new abstract operations and implementing corresponding matching units based on real-world service operations that openISBT does not support yet
    \item Quantifying the improvement of the applicability of openISBT through the new abstract operations
\end{cEnum}
