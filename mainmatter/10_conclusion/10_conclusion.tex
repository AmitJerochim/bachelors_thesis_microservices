%Avoiding Confusion in your Conclusion!
%Many writers confuse the information they should include in their discussion with the information they should place in their conclusion. One easy way to avoid this confusion is to think of your conclusion as a summary of everything that you have said thus far. In the conclusion section, you remind the reader of what they have just read. Your conclusion should:

%Restate your hypothesis or research question
%-Restate your major findings
%-Tell the reader what contribution your study has made to the existing literature
%-Highlight any limitations of your study
%-State future directions for research/recommendations

%Your conclusion should NOT:
%-Introduce new arguments
%-Introduce new data
%-Fail to include your research question
%-Fail to state your major results
